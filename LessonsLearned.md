# Lessons Learned  
Lessons learned while working on the course:  
- how to declare variables in JS:
  - let creates a variable only accessible in the block where it's defined
  - const also has block accessibility, but cannot be reassigned or redefined (as the name implies)
  - var creates a variable accessible throghout the function it's created in
- what a text node is
  - all viewable text in HTML is wrapped as a text node
  - it allows us to take text in JavaScript and place it into HTML
